"""Whisper-based wake listener.

Reuses the same Whisper STT endpoint that handles F9 transcriptions and
detects the wake phrase after the fact. Lets us support arbitrary wake
phrases (e.g. "hey halo") without training a custom keyword-spotter.

Control flow:

    idle
      └─▶ mic sample RMS > EOU_ENERGY_THRESHOLD
            └─▶ recorder.start(source="whisper_wake", vad_endpoint=True)
                  └─▶ recorder captures until EOU_SILENCE_MS of silence
                        └─▶ recorder POSTs clip to Whisper
                              └─▶ if transcription matches WAKE_PHRASE:
                                    strip phrase, type remainder
                                  else:
                                    silent drop

The recorder does the heavy lifting (VAD-endpointed capture, Whisper
POST, focus gate, typing, auto-submit). We just watch audio energy and
flip the recorder on.
